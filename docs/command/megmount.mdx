# `megmount`

```js
megmount [entity:<entity>] [model:<active_model>] [bone:<bone>] (driver) (passenger) (dismount) (interactable) (damageable)
```

Mounts the given entity on the given modeled entity, either as a passenger or the driver.

The "bone_name" argument is required if the entity is being mounted as a passenger. It specifies which bone the entity will be mounted on.
You can find out mountable bone names by opening the model in Blockbench. More info on this can be found here: https://git.lumine.io/mythiccraft/model-engine-4/-/wikis/Modeling/Bone-Behaviors#mount

The "dismount" argument is optional, but will dismount the entity if specified.
The "interactable" and "damageable" arguments are optional, but make the mount interactable and damageable, respectively.
