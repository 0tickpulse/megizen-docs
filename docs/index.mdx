Megizen is a powerful addon plugin for Denizen that adds interop with the ModelEngine API, allowing users to control models and animations using Denizen scripts.

## Prerequisites

Megizen requires the following plugins to be installed:

- [Denizen](https://denizenscript.com/)
- [ModelEngine R4.0+](https://mythiccraft.io/index.php?resources/model-engine%E2%80%94ultimate-entity-model-manager-1-19-4-1-20-4.1213/)

You should have a basic understanding of both of these plugins before using Megizen.
You can learn more about Denizen [here](https://guide.denizenscript.com/) and ModelEngine [here](https://git.lumine.io/mythiccraft/modelengine/-/wikis/home).
